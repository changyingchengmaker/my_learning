\begin{abstract}
    This is a simple example of a \LaTeX{} document.
It includes a title, an abstract, some sections, and a math equation.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
    This document demonstrates the structure of a basic LaTeX file. You can create sections, add equations, and include figures.

\section{Math Example}
    Here is an example of a mathematical equation:
\[
E = mc^2
\]

\section{Conclusion}
LaTeX is great for producing professional-looking documents, especially those that contain mathematics.

\section{my physics}
    the law of rotation:
\begin{equation}
    \sum_i F_{i\tau}  r_i + \sum_i f_{i\tau}   r_i = \left( \sum_i \Delta m_i r_i^2 \right) \beta
\end{equation}
\end{document}
```

To compile this, save it as `example.tex` and use a LaTeX compiler like `pdflatex` or an online editor like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

Would you like an example that includes figures, tables, or references as well?
